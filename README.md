# Project Background
In today's digital age, online shopping has become the go-to option for many consumers. However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the shopping experience daunting. To address this, we have developed ShopAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of large language models and rule-based functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery.

# Problem Statement
Given a dataset containing information about laptops (product names, specifications, descriptions, etc.), build a chatbot that parses the dataset and provides accurate laptop recommendations based on user requirements.

# Installs Required
